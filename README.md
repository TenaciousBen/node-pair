# Introduction 
Your company has decided to take their hotel search service online and expose it to customers the world over üåç.

Senior leadership are convinced that customers need to be able to search by:

 * the experiences on offer at the hotel
 * the dates of their travel
 * the number of travellers on their trip

Although no-one was able to articulate why, it's also necessary that customers are able to order their results by:

* price
* total discount
* alphabetically A-Z
* alphabetically Z-A

Your job is to tie together the three repositories for hotels, experiences and offers into a single search service, map it into the form expected by the view layer and complete the API route that the view layer will use for searches. Good luck!
